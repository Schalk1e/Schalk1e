Hey, I'm Schalk1e :wave:

I'm a data systems enthusiast from RSA :sa-flag: with experience in data processing, architecture and analytics.

At work I manage data infrastructure and integrations, look for efficiency (and cost!) gains in our various AWS clusters
and mentor new team members.

I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and have gotten my hands dirty in most cloud environments.

When I'm not working or writing small utility programs to make my life easier, you'll find me in the outdoors,
making music, pruning a bonsai, doing (often bad) woodworking and DIY projects or watching Epic History on YouTube.

I also sometimes try to play golf, but that's a different story.

If you'd like to collaborate on any Open Source project, please shout!
