Hey, I'm Schalk1e :wave:

I'm a data systems enthusiast from 🇿🇦 with experience in data processing, architecture and analytics.

At work I manage data infrastructure and integrations, look for efficiency (and cost!) gains in our various AWS clusters and mentor new team members.

I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and have gotten my hands dirty in most cloud environments ☁️

When I'm not working or writing small utility programs to make my life easier, you'll find me in the outdoors,
making music, pruning a bonsai, exploring woodworking and DIY projects or watching Epic History on YouTube.
When time permits, I like to dabble in security and CTF challenges.

I also sometimes try to play golf, but that's a different story.

If you'd like to collaborate on any Open Source project, please shout! 🚀
